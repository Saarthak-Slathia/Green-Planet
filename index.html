                <h3>What is This <color>Eco-System</color> ?</h3>
                <p>According to Wikipedia, <strong>"An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with
                        the nonliving components of their environment, interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic
                        components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows."</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>This means that we all are in an eco-system and we depend on living as well as non-living things for
                    survival and same also applies for other living and non-living things.</p>

                <h2>Plant a tree on any occassion</h2>
                <p>Plant atleast 1 tree on any special occassion like your birthday, any festival etc. Trees are important as they filter out the carbon-di-oxide that we breath out in the air to fresh pure oxygen which we breath in. They also provide us food, air, medecines and the list is endless.</p>

                <h2>Switch off devices when not in use.</h2>
                <p>Switching off the devices like fans, lights etc. helps in reducing electricity usage, not only your electricity bill ü§ë but as a fact that a large portion of the electricity is generated by burning coal and fossil fuels which leads to air pollution.</p>

                <h2>Don't Waste Water</h2>
                <p>Switch off the tap while bushing and don't use shower while bathing as there is a lot of water being wasted while you brush with the tap running on. Using a bucket and a mug while bathing can be useful as in showers the quantity of water being wasted is too much üíß</p>

                <p>Throw wastes into dustbins, dry waste in blue one and wet waste in green, hazardous in red etc. This helps to reduce land pollution. Along with following this and throwing the waste in dustbins, also try to spread awareness amongg others to reduce pollution by the same.</p>

                <p>Don't use plastic bags while going to shopping. Try to use paper straws and not plastic straws. As plastic is <color>"non-biodegradable"</color>, ie - which cannot be decomposed, it harms the environment as it is too difficult to get rid of it. If we burn it, it releases poisonous and hazardous gases.</p>

            <h2>Why to Save The Environment ?</h2>
            <p>If you are looking for the answer of üëÜüèª question, scroll down.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <div data-aos="flip-right" class="workBx">
                <p>Now, surely you might have some vehicle, car, bike etc. So what does it require to run a car ? it takes fuel such as petrol, diesel, natural gas etc. Of course you have to pay when you have to fill your vehicle with petrol, diesel etc. So it also costs a lot. But why our fuels, more importantly, fossil fuels, are getting expensive day-by-day ? </p>
            </div>
            <div data-aos="flip-left" class="workBx">
                <p>It is because these resources are limited and they are gradualy getting finished. That's why they are getting expensive. But why are they getting finished ? This is because fossil fuels form when life forms get compressed due to pressure in these <strong>millions of years</strong>. The bold word millions of years is important. It is very difficult to replenish these sources at a reliable rate in respect to which we are using it.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-aos="flip-right" class="workBx">
                <p>This was just one example of fossil fuels and of our problems and the cause for saving the environment. There are many other problems such as water, air pollution etc. Water shortage is also one of the problems that we are facing. If you want the proof, <a href="https://saarthak-slathia.github.io/Eco-Saviour/#water" target="#">Go Here</a><br>Air pollution is another our daily life problem, people are already using face masks because of the air quality. I causes many harmful diseases like <strong>Aasthma</strong> ü§ß, <strong>Diarrhea</strong> ü§¢ etc. <a href="https://saarthak-slathia.github.io/Eco-Saviour/#air" target="#">Go here for the air pollution and its solution.</a></p>

            <div data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-offset="100" class="workBx">
                <p>If you have the question about why to <strong>save</strong> energy as it is already saved due to law of conservation of energy which states that <strong>"Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed"</strong>, then here's the answer to your question. <br>The answer is that the main thing is not <strong>conserving</strong> energy, it is in fact <strong>to save energy from getting "converted" from useful to non-useful form.</strong> and the law of conservation of energy doesn't say that energy cannot be converted from one form to another. That's what we and you as well should be worried about. ü§î</p>
